# Announcements

Announcements are stored in `announcements/`. Currently the frontend just
renders all announcements, hopefully that gets fixed soon...

To make a new announcement, copy paste this template:

```
---
id: announcement-id-here
date: "Jan 7, 2025"
title: "Here's An Announcement Title"
order: 4
---

Announcements are rendered in REVERSE order number.
```
